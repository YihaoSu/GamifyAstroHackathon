## Goals of the game
Why do I want to hold astronomy hackathons for high school students/the general public?
* Participants can understand:
  * what is open source?
  * what is open science/astronomy? 
  * how astronomy research, education, outreach and citation science can benefit from open astronomy?
* Regardless of their background, all participants can make contributions to astronmy research, education, outreach by collaborating during hackathons (general definition of citizen astronomy?)
