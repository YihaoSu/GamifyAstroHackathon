This is my hack during the [Astro Hack Week 2019](http://astrohackweek.org/2019/). Welcome any contributions and feedbacks :smiley:

## Why gamify astronomy hackathon?
* [See the hack idea](https://github.com/YihaoSu/GamifyAstronomyHackathon/blob/master/HackIdeas.md)

## Goals of the game
Why do I want to hold astronomy hackathons for high school students/the general public?
* Participants can understand:
  * what is open source?
  * what is open science/astronomy? 
  * how astronomy research, education, outreach and citation science can benefit from open astronomy?
* Regardless of their background, all participants can make contributions to astronmy research, education, outreach by collaborating during hackathons (general definition of citizen astronomy?)

## Design the player’s journey in astronomy hackathons
* [Player’s Journey Design](https://github.com/YihaoSu/GamifyAstronomyHackathon/blob/master/PlayersJourney.md)

### Ideas about designing the discovery phase of astronomy hackathons
* Build a mentorship: in the application form, applicants need to select a character during the hackathon:
  * Egg or Seed (newcomer, no experience, need help)
  * Cultivator (have some experiences and skills, can take care newcomers)

### Ideas about designing the onboarding phase of astronomy hackathons
* [A pre-hacking activity template](./OnboardingPhase_PreHackingActivity.md) ([Demo in HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@astrobackhacker/By8aMzNSS))

### Ideas about designing the scaffolding phase of astronomy hackathons
