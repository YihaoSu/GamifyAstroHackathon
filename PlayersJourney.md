## The discovery phase of astronomy hackathons
* Problems to be solved (based on [the survey for a previous astronomy hackathon hold in Taiwan](https://coggle.it/diagram/XO_ETNAsCBx_Q-6r/t/20190525%E8%88%88%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%84%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%A9%E6%96%87%E9%BB%91%E5%AE%A2%E6%9D%BE%E5%8F%83%E8%88%87%E8%80%85%E5%95%8F%E5%8D%B7%E5%9B%9E%E9%A5%8B/5de4484f926ef6a3842e2b0bbbfef87af42cb01b847269970d1559ca345cd6e5)):

    * Egg or Seed (newcomer, no experience, need help)
    * Cultivator (have some experiences and skills, can take care newcomers)
    * ...
