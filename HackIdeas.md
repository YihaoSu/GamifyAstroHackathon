## Title
Applying gamification to astronomy hackathons for high school students

## Hack Creator
Yi-Hao Su

## Why?
Inspired by my experience at the Astro Hack Week 2015, my partners and I have held astronomy hackathons for high school students in Taiwan. However, because of lack of hackathon and programing experiences, students have difficulties to propose hack ideas and solve problem by programing and collaborating. Therefore, I want to use gamification to improve the onboarding phase and student engagement.

## What?
The blog posts about the gamification framework Octalysis

## How?
* Share experiences of playing video and board games
* Discuss and analyze which Octalysis core drives used by these games
* Design hackathon activities via game elements/mechanics fitted these Octalysis core drives

## Who?
Anyone who is interested in applying gamification to astronomy education.
