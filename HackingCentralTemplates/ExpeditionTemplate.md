Below, you'll find a template for you to fill out with your hack ideas. It will guide you through developing your project idea into something that is manageable in the time available during the week, and also aid you in recruiting the help they might need. 

## Why?
* What is the problem to be solved?
* Why is this problem important? 
* What progress can we make this week on this problem?

## What?
* What resources are needed to complete the project?
* Is any data set needed ready to be used, or are there significant data processing/cleaning steps? Note: Unless the hack itself is a data cleaning hack (totally valid hack, by the way!), itâ€™s best if the data access/processing/cleaning is done in advance of the hack week.
* What computational resources are needed, and is access to them secured?

## How?
* What are the steps and tasks needed to complete the project?
* How much time is each step projected to take? Remember that things often tend to take longer than you expect!

## Who?
* Are there any minimum knowledge requirements for helping out with the project?
* Is there a space for participants with little knowledge? E.g. in trying out code, writing documentation, helping with tutorials ...
* What skills are particularly relevant to the project?
